# Week 1 Â· Microprocessor Basics, Arduino and Particle Platforms, Photoresistor Theremin

Welcome to Digital Development Workshop, Spring 2018. In this course, the fundamentals of microcontrollers, electronics, and functional programming will be covered through explorations into digital and experimental musicianship.

The course will rely upon the exciting opportunities offered by the Particle Photon prototyping platform, though the code and components should run on any Arduino compatible board after necessary pin number alternations.
