# Week 2 Â· Sound of Electricity

In order to advance our microprocessor-related design skills, it is important to understand how electricity works. Electricity is very difficult to grasp, as it is multidimensional in a way that very few other physical phenomena are. Very often, electricity is analogized as water in a plumbing system, though even this analogy does not account for all of the variables that electricity offers.

- This [particular resource from Sparkfun.com](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law/voltage) offers a good summary of the water analogy for electricity.

- [This is a more in-depth introduction](https://www.tigoe.com/pcomp/code/circuits/understanding-electricity/) that covers basic electronics components as well.

- Homework: Connect your Photon to your home network. Plug in your photon at home, hold down the setup button for 3 seconds, and the Photon will flash blue. It is now ready for [your phone to connect to it](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/start/photon/) to configure its wifi settings. 
- Homework: Wire up the [3 Tone Keyboard circuit](exercise.md) at home. Try running the software!
