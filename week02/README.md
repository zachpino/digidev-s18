# Week 2 Â· Sound of Electricity

In order to advance our microprocessor-related design skills, it is important to understand how electricity works. Electricity is very difficult to grasp, as it is multidimensional in a way that very few other physical phenomena are. Very often, electricity is analogized as water in a plumbing system, though even this analogy does not account for all of the variables that electricity offers.
