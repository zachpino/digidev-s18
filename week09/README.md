Let's take our DAC pin and SD card reader, along with some MP3s, and learn how to playback real music!

---

- [Download Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net)
- [Download Wav2C](https://github.com/olleolleolle/wav2c)
- [Download Sublime](http://sublimetext.com)

- Prepare [Audio Files for Playback](prep.md)
- Don't Want to Prepare Your Own MP3s? [Download Examples!](example.md)
- Make a [Sampled Audio File Playback Device](exercise.md)

- Homework: Get your [microphone working](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-microphone-amplifier-breakout/measuring-sound-levels)
- Homework: Make an 8 Sound Sample/FX Board, with 8 different controls connected to 8 different audio files. You can use your captouch sensor, or any other sensor, to trigger playback. Could you capture data with your microphone for playback as well? Short, unusual clips will work best!
