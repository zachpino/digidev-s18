# Final Briefs

## Wearable, Tabletop, or Spatial Synthesizers

Develop a physical object composed of a set of sensors and audio feedback that allows for wide expressability, novel interactions, and intentional musicality. Bonus points for the development of an accompanying DJ persona.

###### Deliverables	 

* Prototyped Working Object (or scale model if necessary)
* Fritzing Diagram of Circuit
* Photographic Documentation of Project
* *Edited* Video Demonstrating Functionality

* Set of MP3s of Practiced Compositions on Synthesizer
* Instruction Manual Educating an Inexperienced User

-----

## Musical Human Factors

Choose a physical object/space that currently lacks sonic feedback — and through a combination of *non-invasive* sensors — provide feedback that makes the object/space more engaging in its use, more intuitive to learn or master, and/or safer for an end-user to engage. 
	
###### Deliverables	 

* Prototyped Working Object
* Fritzing Diagram of Circuit
* Photographic Documentation of Project
* *Edited* Video Demonstrating Functionality

* Storyboard of Proposed Functionality in Context
* Instruction Manual Educating an Inexperienced User

## Sound Design for Social Impact

*Read this vague, yearly-renewed grant call for proposals carefully and in its entirety*

[Help America Vote Act Grant Application](https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=293206)

This public grant — awarding up to $220,000 per winner — tasks applicants to make the American polling places easier for users with visuo-spatial impairments. How could electronically-produced sonic feedback be used to improve the voting experience for such users? Are there other, significant, public experiences that could be similarly improved?

###### Deliverables	 

* Prototyped Working Object
* Fritzing Diagram of Circuit
* Photographic Documentation of Project
* *Edited* Video Demonstrating Functionality

* Documentation of an Interview with a Potential User
* Storyboard of Proposed Functionality in Context

-----

## Electronic Sonic Play

Create a toy for children that allows the capture, creation, manipulation, and production of sound. 

Additional design challenge: Sonic feedback is especially helpful to many children on the autistic-asbergers spectrum. How could the toy described above be made more appropriate and valuable for this underserved audience?

###### Deliverables	 

* Prototyped Working Object
* Fritzing Diagram of Circuit
* Photographic Documentation of Project
* *Edited* Video Demonstrating Functionality

* Documentation of an Interview with a Potential User
* Storyboard of Proposed Functionality in Context

-----

## Sensor Bomb for Designing with Data

Combine a set of related sensors into a composed object that both captures and produces sound in some way and is able to generate an acoustic fingerprint of its environment. This object could be proposed as an answer to any of the many [grants.gov grants](http://grants.gov) currently on offer, which require a set of sensors to be deployed in a specific environment.

###### Deliverables	 

* Prototyped Working Object
* Fritzing Diagram of Circuit
* Photographic Documentation of Project
* *Edited* Video Demonstrating Functionality

* Storyboard of Proposed Functionality in Context
* Designed Data Visualization for Logged Data
