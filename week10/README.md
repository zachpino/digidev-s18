# Week 10 Â· Sensor Diversity

Let's play with a couple of easy-to-implement sensors, which expand the limits of our computational intelligence. No sample code crutches this week!

- Homework: Use one of the sensors introduced this week to create a *wearable* musical instument capable of generating not only distinct notes, but also distinct rhythms.
- Homework: Continue work on refining your [final deliverable strategy](../briefs.md). Consider what you might need to order for your project from [Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com) or [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com).
